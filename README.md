# video-blockchain

*** I am pretty tired of people censoring videos online, the goal of this project is to give no-one power to destroy any video in this blockchain. 

The project will convert each video when uploaded into bytes (We should find a better method), it will convert it back to a video when user watch it (or when server is running - best option should be the method).

The project will consist both of a front-end for users to watch the video and a backend which control the blockchain.

## Goal of this project:
* No one can delete any videos.
* Fast and file-size


To all the people who "hate" on this project and see it as dangerous for society. I will just say F* you.. make your own shit instead of trying to take my shit down.

Also i do not own - control this blockchain, i am not the main developer i am just the one who got the idea. This project is created by the people for the people.
